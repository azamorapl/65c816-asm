#Misc patches for Super Metroid

Includes edits that alter their original functionality.

##Control Freak + Project Base compatibility
by Kejardon, begrimed and PHOSPHOTiDYL

Compatibility patch that allows Control Freak and Project Base to work without conflicts.
Apply pb_moves.asm or Project Base, ControlFreak2.asm, and projectcontrolfreakbase.asm.

Bug fixes. Also includes an UI patch that changes the way items are highlighted.

##Map Item Circles
by Scyzer

Adds dots/circles on the map when there are items, like the GBA games.

This one is a rush job. Tweaked to display a different icon when upgrades are found, and allows two items on a same room without the icons overlapping each other.

##Item Sounds
by Scyzer

Changes the sound when a pickup is acquired.

Tweaked to play a different sound when expansions are acquired.

##Morph Flash
by Black Falcon

Makes Samus flash when morphing/unmorphing.

Tweaked to play a sound when morphing/unmorphing, and repointed some instructions.

##Demo Timer

Alters the timer that plays when idling too long on the title screen to correct some bugs with Project Base.
